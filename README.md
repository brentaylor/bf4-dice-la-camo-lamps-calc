Lamps are counted looking north, the 1st is at your left and the most far (having north on top of your map is at top, left).

1. Before anything insert the initial status of the lamps

2. Swicth on every button (one at time) and insert the new status, then switch off

3. The final status (once all buttons are switched on and off) may be different from the initial, doesn't matter, copy the initial status into the final.
